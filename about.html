      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p> <img src="images/mebg.png" alt="a picture of me" class="align-right" />
        My name is Fatimah Baaghil. I am a fast learner and hardworking individual.
         I have always been in awe of the craft of movie-making. The work and time involved in creating
         a finished product is intense. The entire movie-making process, from the original idea and concept
          to the final editing process, is a beautiful form of art. I have watched many behind-the-scenes making of films,
          enthralled with the process in which every single person plays a key role in the making of a film. Oftentimes,
          I have enjoyed a movie much more after watching the amount of work that has been put into a film.
          I have always dreamed of working at Disney. Watching Disneyâ€™s attention to detail for each of their films and shorts demonstrates a passion I have always wanted to
         share and be a part of. I have written, directed, filmed, and edited a documentary, a short film, and school projects using Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere Pro programs.
         I would also love to be a part of start-up companies in need of a director or filmmaker.
